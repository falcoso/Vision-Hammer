10/10/19 - First Supervision

  First meeting with Joan. Discussed initial Risk assessment. Games workshop are
  unable to provide CAD models for training, but JL will contact Hugo in the
  dept who has been working on voxel carving to potentially scan in models. Need
  to bring in models next week to show, as well as start making some cardboard
  models of scenery to work with.

  Further work:
  python-pcl may be a useful point cloud library. Look into registration using
  ICP in the open3d library. A lot of mention of mixture of gaussians.

11/10/19 - Cameras

  Prices of the Realsense can vary upwards of £150, although a second hand
  v2 Kinect can go for as little as £40, comparisons online show less resolution
  with the kinect but much fewer noise artifacts and therefore a clearer point
  cloud image.

  Kinect v2: 0.5m-4.5m
  RealSense: 0.2-1.2m

Created a set of several related point clouds to try registering with open3d.
  Global method uses RASNAC and then refines to a more accurate registration
  with ICP. However, matching doesn't seem very good out the box even with what
  appears to be very similar clouds.

  Created CAD model for a building that can be laser cut to start creating a
  board top from which to produce LOS.

18/10/19 - Registration works!

  https://towardsdatascience.com/point-cloud-data-simple-approach-f3855fdc08f5
  Created some cleaner point clouds which are simply models on a table with
  blinds in the background. This makes registration a much simpler task. Also
  looked at Colored Point Cloud Registration Revisited which makes use of the
  fact that we have a colour image to overlay. Now need to look into how I can
  automatically clean up the data by removing outliers.

  Have done some reading on further registration techniques, the mention of GMM
  models basically involves clustering GMMs at different levels of hierarchy.
  The mean of each cluster tells you its location and the variance matrix give
  the shape i.e. an eigenvalue close to 0 means that the cluster is likely a
  plane.

  Created a simple script that tries to bin the most common normals in a scene.
  Doesn't actually produce perfect normals to the large planes in the point
  clouds but, may be useful as a finger print to work out initial rotations.
